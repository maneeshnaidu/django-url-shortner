# Django URL Shortner

This is a simple portfolio project for basic understanding of the Django framework. This application takes an input from the user which can be a long https link and outputs a supposedly shortened URL which is displayed and can also be accessed when clicked. The project is also hosted using Heroku CLI and Heroku Git.
